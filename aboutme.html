        Hi! My name is Cecilia Frias, I am a first year transfer student at Columbia.
         My major is User Experience and Interation Design, but my primary experience is in Graphic Design. 
         I live in the city now, but I lived with my parents before in Oswego which is about an hour west of Chicago. I am second generation American on both sides of my family.
         My dad's family is from Mexico and my mom's family is from England!
         So I have family from all over the world which allows me to travel a lot.
         I have been to 10 different countries so far! I plan on studying abroad for a semester while here at Columbia and I'm very
         excited to further my education where ever I can!
    </p>
